For all runs in this directory, we use the same BBH source parameters:

injection = dict(
    chirp_mass=34.8,
    mass_ratio=1,
    chi_1=0,
    chi_2=0,
    luminosity_distance=1000,
    geocent_time=1126259642.5,
    phase=1.577,
    theta_jn=0.48736165,
    dec=-1.0108,
    ra=1.7475,
    psi=2.6597,
)

When using Cosmic Explorer (CE), we use bilby's built-in CE interferometer object. This gives us an SNR of 969.82
For the aLIGO runs, we use bilby's H1 and L1 interferometer objects in tandem. This gives us a network SNR of 32.48

For the source parameters: runs were performed with distance and phase marginalization while sampling in chirp mass and geocent time. All other source parameters were fixed at their injection values

For the ppE parameters, we use priors:

prior['beta_tilde'] = bilby.core.prior.Uniform(name='beta_tilde',latex_label=r'$\tilde{\beta}$',minimum=-2,maximum=2)
prior['delta_epsilon_tilde'] = bilby.core.prior.Uniform(name='delta_epsilon_tilde',latex_label=r'$\delta\tilde{\epsilon}$',minimum=-2,maximum=2)
prior['b'] = bilby.core.prior.Uniform(name='b',latex_label=r'$b$',minimum=-5,maximum=4)

The prior boundaries on beta_tilde and delta_epsilon_tilde are motivated by mismatch contour plots where a 2x2 square can encapsulate the <10% mismatch region in beta_tilde-delta_epsilon_tilde space
The minimum b value is -5, where -5 corresponds to a 0 PN correction. On the other side, we use b=4, corresponding to a 4.5 PN correction. 

To Investigate: including b values beyond b=4 in the prior causes parameter estimation to stall; some value between 4 and 5 is some sort of critical value

For the bGR-bGR runs, we inject beta_tilde=0.5 and delta_epsilon_tilde=-0.25.

For the beta-b plot, we use a total mass of 80 solar masses. To simulate CE and aLIGO in this plot, we choose different minimum frequencies, 
arguing that CE's lower noise curve allows for the detection of waveforms down to around 5 Hz. aLIGO's noise curve demands a minimum frequency of around 20 Hz.
